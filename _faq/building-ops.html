        <p><strong>Q: Who is responsible for providing hand sanitizer in GSA-controlled facilities?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  GSA will provide hand sanitizer in the building entrances and common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities. In GSA-controlled lease locations, the lessor is responsible for procuring and providing hand sanitizer in building entrances and common areas. Individual agencies are responsible for procuring and providing hand sanitizer within their occupied spaces, whether leased or federally owned. Agencies will also make available wipes and other EPA-approved disinfectants, as necessary, for individuals to wipe down their workstation and related personal property within their occupied areas.</p>

            Occupancy, Physical Distancing, and Avoiding Crowding<span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong><strong>Q: Can Federal agencies put in place facility-level occupancy limits solely for the purposes of facilitating physical distancing?</strong></p>
        <p>A. No. To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies should not establish facility-level occupancy limits solely for the purpose of facilitating physical distancing as a COVID-19 prevention action, absent an exception approved by the agency head following consultation with the agency COVID-19 Coordination Team and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force.</p>
        <p>When <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html"_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Levels</a> are MEDIUM or HIGH, agencies can consider establishing occupancy limits for indoor common areas and meeting rooms in Federal facilities, and in high-risk settings within Federal facilities, where necessary, including where ventilation and air filtration is challenging to improve despite agency efforts to the maximum extent feasible, or crowding cannot otherwise be avoided.</p>
            
        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong><strong>Q: Should Federal agencies require that individuals physically distance from others?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, Federal agencies should not require that individuals physically distance from others. Rather, to be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, if <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html"_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Levels</a> are MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, then agencies would need to post signage encouraging individuals to consider avoiding crowding and physically distancing themselves from others in indoor common areas, meeting rooms, and high-risk settings in Federal facilities.</p>
