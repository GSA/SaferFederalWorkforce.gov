        <p><strong>Q: Who is responsible for providing hand sanitizer in GSA-controlled facilities?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  GSA will provide hand sanitizer in the building entrances and common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities. In GSA-controlled lease locations, the lessor is responsible for procuring and providing hand sanitizer in building entrances and common areas. Individual agencies are responsible for procuring and providing hand sanitizer within their occupied spaces, whether leased or federally owned. Agencies will also make available wipes and other EPA-approved disinfectants, as necessary, for individuals to wipe down their workstation and related personal property within their occupied areas.</p>

If a product you want to purchase is backordered on GSA Advantage!, we recommend you contact the vendor directly, as stock levels change daily.</p>

            Cleaning and Disinfection
        </button>

    <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p><strong>Q: What level of environmental cleaning does GSA provide for GSA-controlled facilities?</strong></p>
        <p>A: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html#anchor_1617548446719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC guidance</a> indicates that routine cleaning once a day is usually enough to sufficiently remove virus that may be on surfaces and help maintain a healthy facility. GSA will routinely clean surfaces using cleaning products that contain soap or detergent.</p>
        <p>GSA will continue to clean and disinfect any space occupied or accessed by an individual with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19, if 72 hours or less have passed since the affected person was last in the space. If more than 72 hours have passed since the person with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 has been in the space, no additional cleaning, beyond the regular cleaning practices, is needed, consistent with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html#anchor_1617548446719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC guidance</a>.
