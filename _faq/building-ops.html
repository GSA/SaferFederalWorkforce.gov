        <p>A:  GSA’s regular custodial service for GSA-controlled facilities includes the routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in common and high-traffic areas of the facility, with the exception of individual workstations and related personal property, which are the occupant agency’s responsibility to clean and disinfect. In the event of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the workplace, agencies should perform enhanced environmental cleaning of the spaces that the individual occupied or accessed in accordance with CDC and, where applicable, GSA guidelines.</p>
