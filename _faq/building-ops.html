        <p><strong>Q:  Does GSA already provide the level of environmental cleaning required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-21-15 or does my agency need to ask for that service?</strong></p>

GSA performs enhanced environmental cleaning in response to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, in accordance with CDC guidelines.</p>
