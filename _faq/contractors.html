   <p><strong>Update on Executive Order 14042&nbsp;</strong>(October 19, 2022): Consistent with the <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/">October 14, 2022 notification</a> from the Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (&ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;), OMB has issued <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/OMB%20Guidance%20for%20Agencies_EO%2014042_20221019.pdf">guidance</a> to agencies concerning the implementation of Executive Order 14042, <em>Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors</em> (Sept. 9, 2021). Despite the lifting of the nationwide bar to enforcement on October 18, 2022, at this time agencies should not: (1) take any steps to require covered contractors and subcontractors to come into compliance with previously issued Task Force guidance; or (2) enforce any contract clauses implementing Executive Order 14042. To allow time to develop advice and processes for meeting agencies&rsquo; obligations under Executive Order 14042 and applicable court orders, agencies should follow the instructions provided in the OMB guidance <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/OMB%20Guidance%20for%20Agencies_EO%2014042_20221019.pdf">here</a>.</p>
   <p><strong>Update on Executive Order 14042</strong> (October 14, 2022): The Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (&ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;) previously provided guidance explaining that, to ensure compliance with an applicable preliminary nationwide injunction, the Federal Government will take no action to enforce any contract clause implementing requirements of Executive Order 14042 absent further written notice from the contracting agency. In anticipation of a potential narrowing of the existing nationwide injunction due to developments in ongoing litigation, OMB and the Task Force are clarifying that they anticipate that three guidance documents will be issued following any narrowing of the nationwide injunction. <u>First</u>, after any narrowing of the nationwide injunction, OMB will issue a notice to Federal agencies regarding, among other things, compliance with applicable injunctions and whether contract clauses implementing Executive Order 14042 should be included in new solicitations and contracts. <u>Second</u>, the Task Force will issue updated written guidance regarding COVID-19 safety protocols for covered contractor and subcontractor workplace locations, which will include a timeline for implementation. This updated guidance will be issued following development and review by the Task Force, subject to the OMB Director&rsquo;s approval and determination published in the Federal Register that the updated guidance promotes economy and efficiency in Federal contracting, in accordance with Executive Order 14042. <u>Third</u>, after this updated Task Force guidance is issued and if the OMB Director makes the requisite determinations, OMB will provide guidance to agencies on timeline and considerations for the contracting agency&rsquo;s written notice to contractors regarding enforcement of any contract clauses implementing requirements of Executive Order 14042, excepting any contracts or contractors covered by applicable injunctions. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors">For Federal Contractors</a> for additional information.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do covered contractors determine vaccination status of visitors to covered contractor workplaces?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Covered contractors should post signage at entrances to covered contractor workplaces providing information on safety protocols for fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated individuals, including the protocols defined in the masking and physical distancing section in the Task Force’s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a>, and instruct individuals to follow the appropriate workplace safety protocols while at the covered contractor workplace. Covered contractors may take other reasonable steps, such as by communicating workplace safety protocols to visitors prior to their arrival at a covered contractor workplace or requiring all visitors to follow masking and physical distancing protocols for not fully vaccinated individuals.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is there sample signage that a covered contractor can post at entrances to covered contractor workplaces providing information on safety protocols?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. Covered contractors should post signage at entrances to covered contractor workplaces providing information on safety protocols for fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated individuals and instruct individuals to follow the appropriate workplace safety protocols while at the covered contractor workplace. Sample signage for areas of high or substantial levels of community transmission can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Mask_Distancing_High-Substantial_Transmission_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Sample signage for areas of low or moderate levels of community transmission can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Mask_Distancing_Low-Moderate_Transmission_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do covered contractors need to provide onsite vaccinations to their employees?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Covered contractors should ensure their employees are aware of <a href="http://www.vaccines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convenient opportunities to be vaccinated</a>. Although covered contractors may choose to provide vaccinations at their facilities or workplaces, given the widespread availability of vaccinations, covered contractors are not required to do so.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If a covered contractor can access a covered contractor employee’s vaccination documentation, consistent with relevant privacy laws, does the covered contractor need to require the employee to show or provide documentation?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. If, consistent with all relevant privacy laws, a covered contractor can access its employee’s vaccination documentation directly, such as when the contractor previously requested the employee to provide vaccination documentation, has existing documentation from an employee vaccination program, or can access information through a State’s immunization database, the covered contractor does not need to require its employee to show or provide documentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should a contractor employee do if a covered contractor employee has lost or does not have a copy of required vaccination documentation?</strong></p>
        <p>A: If covered contractor employees need new vaccination cards or copies of other documentation proof of vaccination, they should contact the vaccination provider site where they received their vaccine. Their provider should be able to provide them with new cards or documentation with up-to-date information about the vaccinations they have received. If the location where the covered contractor employees received their COVID-19 vaccine is no longer operating, the covered contractor employees should contact their State or local health department’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunization information system (IIS)</a> for assistance. Covered contractor employees should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/hd-search/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact their State or local health department</a> if they have additional questions about vaccination cards or vaccination records.</p>
        <p>An attestation of vaccination by the covered contractor employee is not an acceptable substitute for documentation of proof of vaccination.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Who is responsible for determining if a covered contractor employee must be provided an accommodation because of a disability or because of a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  A covered contractor may be required to provide an accommodation to contractor employees who communicate to the covered contractor that they are not vaccinated for COVID-19, or that they cannot wear a mask, because of a disability (which would include medical conditions) or because of a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance. A covered contractor should review and consider what, if any, accommodation it must offer. The contractor is responsible for considering, and dispositioning, such requests for accommodations regardless of the covered contractor employee’s place of performance. If the agency that is the party to the covered contract is a “joint employer” for purposes of compliance with the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, both the agency and the covered contractor should review and consider what, if any, accommodation they must offer.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do all requests for accommodation need to be resolved by the covered contractor by the time that covered contractor employees begin work on a covered contract or at a covered workplace?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. The covered contractor may still be reviewing requests for accommodation as of the time that covered contractor employees begin work on a covered contract or at a covered workplace. While accommodation requests are pending, the covered contractor must require a covered contractor employee with a pending accommodation request to follow workplace safety protocols for individuals who are not fully vaccinated as specified in the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If a covered contractor employee requests an accommodation, and that accommodation is denied by the covered contractor, how long should the contractor employee be afforded to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Covered contractors should establish a timeline for a covered contractor employee whose request for an accommodation is denied to promptly become fully vaccinated.</p>
         
        <p><strong>Q: Is vaccination for COVID-19 recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant or might become pregnant in the future?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Does the CDC recommend that an individual delay vaccination due to pregnancy?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to become pregnant now, or trying to become pregnant in the future</a>. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2021/07/acog-smfm-recommend-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommend</a> that all pregnant individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, a covered contractor may allow a covered contractor employee to delay vaccination based on the contractor employee’s particular medical circumstances, consistent with the covered contractor’s process for reviewing delay requests.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can a covered contractor employee delay a COVID-19 vaccine because they have recently received another vaccine, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine?</strong></p>
        <p>A: COVID-19 vaccines may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines on the same day.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Are covered contractor employees who have a prior COVID-19 infection required to be vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, covered contractor employees who have had a prior COVID-19 infection are required to be vaccinated. More information from CDC can be found <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html?s_cid=11572:covid%20vaccine%20after%20having%20covid:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN.Grants:FY21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can a covered contractor accept a recent antibody test from a covered contractor employee to prove vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. A covered contractor cannot accept a recent antibody test from a covered contractor employee to prove vaccination status.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Does the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> apply to outdoor contractor or subcontractor workplace locations?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, the Task Force Guidance applies to contractor or subcontractor workplace locations that are outdoors.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If a covered contractor employee is likely to be present during the period of performance for a covered contract on only one floor or a separate area of a building, site, or facility controlled by a covered contractor, do other areas of the building, site, or facility controlled by a covered contractor constitute a covered contractor workplace?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, unless a covered contractor can affirmatively determine that none of its employees on another floor or in separate areas of the building will come into contact with a covered contractor employee during the period of performance of a covered contract. This would include affirmatively determining that there will be no interactions between covered contractor employees and non-covered contractor employees in those locations during the period of performance on a covered contract, including interactions through use of common areas such as lobbies, security clearance areas, elevators, stairwells, meeting rooms, kitchens, dining areas, and parking garages.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If a covered contractor employee performs their duties in or at only one building, site, or facility on a campus controlled by a covered contractor with multiple buildings, sites, or facilities, are the other buildings, sites, or facility controlled by a covered contractor considered a covered contractor workplace?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, unless a covered contractor can affirmatively determine that none of its employees in or at one building, site, or facility will come into contact with a covered contractor employee during the period of performance of a covered contract. This would include affirmatively determining that there will be no interactions between covered contractor employees and non-covered contractor employees in those locations during the period of performance on a covered contract, including interactions through use of common areas such as lobbies, security clearance areas, elevators, stairwells, meeting rooms, kitchens, dining areas, and parking garages.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Are the workplace safety protocols enumerated in the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> the same irrespective of whether the work is performed at a covered contractor workplace or at a Federal workplace?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Yes. The Task Force Guidance applies to all covered contractor employees and to all contractor or subcontractor workplace locations. While at a Federal workplace, covered contractor employees must also comply with any additional agency workplace safety requirements for that workplace. Because covered contractor employees working on a covered contract need to be fully vaccinated after January 18, 2022, covered contractor employees who work only at a Federal workplace need to be fully vaccinated by that date as well, unless legally entitled to an accommodation.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How does the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> apply to covered contractor employees who are authorized under the covered contract to perform work remotely from their residence?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  An individual working on a covered contract from their residence is a covered contractor employee, and must comply with the vaccination requirement for covered contractor employees, even if the employee never works at either a covered contractor workplace or Federal workplace during the performance of the contract. A covered contractor employee’s residence is not a covered contractor workplace, so while in the residence the individual need not comply with requirements for covered contractor workplaces, including those related to masking and physical distancing, even while working on a covered contract.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: By when must the requirements of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Order 14042</a> be reflected in contracts?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Section 6 of the order lays out a phase-in of the requirements for covered contracts as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contracts awarded prior to October 15 where performance is ongoing – the requirements must be incorporated at the point at which an option is exercised or an extension is made.</li>
            <li>New contracts – the requirements must be incorporated into contracts awarded on or after November 14.  Between October 15 and November 14, agencies must include the clause in the solicitation and are encouraged to include the clause in contracts awarded during this time period but are not required to do so unless the solicitation for such contract was issued on or after October 15.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Q: Must the requirements of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Order 14042</a> be flowed down to all lower-tier subcontractors and, if so, who is responsible for flowing the clause down?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. The requirements in the order apply to subcontractors at all tiers, except for subcontracts solely for the provision of products. The prime contractor must flow the clause down to first-tier subcontractors; higher-tier subcontractors must flow the clause down to the next lower-tier subcontractor, to the point at which subcontract requirements are solely for the provision of products.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Does the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> apply to small businesses?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, the requirement to comply with the Task Force Guidance applies equally to covered contractors regardless of whether they are a small business. This broad application of COVID-19 guidance will more effectively decrease the spread of COVID-19, which, in turn, will decrease worker absence, reduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontractors at workplaces where they are performing work for the Federal Government.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What steps are being taken to promote consistent application of the requirements of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Order 14042</a> across agencies?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The FAR Council will conduct a rulemaking to amend the FAR to include a clause that requires covered contractors performing under FAR-based contracts to comply with the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance</a> for contractor and subcontractor workplace locations. Prior to rulemaking, the FAR Council has developed a clause and recommended that agencies exercise their authority to deviate from the FAR using the procedures set forth in subpart 1.4. Agencies responsible for contracts and contract-like instruments that are not subject to the FAR, such as concession contracts, will be responsible for developing appropriate guidance by October 8, 2021 to incorporate requirements into their covered instruments entered into on or after October 15, 2021.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can agencies incorporate vaccination requirements into contracts that are not covered by Executive Order 14042 (Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Contractors)?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. Consistent with applicable law, agencies are strongly encouraged to incorporate a clause requiring compliance with the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> into contracts that are not covered or directly addressed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Order 14042</a> because the contract is under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold as defined in section 2.101 of the FAR or is a contract or subcontract for the manufacturing of products. Agencies are also strongly encouraged to incorporate a clause requiring compliance with the Task Force Guidance into existing contracts and contract-like instruments prior to the date upon which the order requires inclusion of the clause.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force updates its <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> to add new requirements, do those requirements apply to existing contracts?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. Covered contractors are required to, for the duration of the contract, comply with all Task Force Guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations, including any new Guidance where the OMB Director approves the Guidance and determines that adherence to the Guidance will promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting. The Task Force and OMB plan to ensure any workplace safety protocols reflect what is necessary to decrease the spread of COVID-19.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What constitutes work performed “in connection with” a covered contract?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Employees who perform duties necessary to the performance of the covered contract, but who are not directly engaged in performing the specific work called for by the covered contract, such as human resources, billing, and legal review, perform work in connection with a Federal Government contract.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do the workplace safety protocols in the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> apply to covered contractor employees who perform work outside the United States?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. The workplace safety protocols in the Task Force Guidance do not apply to covered contractor employees who only perform work outside the United States or its outlying areas, as those terms are defined in section 2.101 of the FAR.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If a corporate affiliate of a covered contractor does not otherwise qualify as a covered contractor, are the employees of that affiliate considered covered contractor employees subject to COVID-19 workplace safety protocols for Federal contractors established through Task Force Guidance?</strong></p>
        <p>A: For purposes of Task Force Guidance, business concerns, organizations, or individuals are affiliates of each other if, directly or indirectly: (i) either one controls or has the power to control the other; or (ii) a third party controls or has the power to control both.</p>
        <p>Indicia of control include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, or common use of employees.</p>
       <p>An employee of a corporate affiliate of a covered contractor is considered a covered contractor employee if the employee performs work at a covered contractor workplace.</p>

       <p><strong>Q: If the workplace where a covered contractor’s employees perform work on or in connection with a covered contract is a location owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by a corporate affiliate of a covered contractor that does not otherwise qualify as a covered contractor under Task Force guidance, is the workplace considered a covered contractor workplace?</strong></p>
       <p>A: For purposes of Task Force Guidance, business concerns, organizations, or individuals are affiliates of each other if, directly or indirectly: (i) either one controls or has the power to control the other; or (ii) a third party controls or has the power to control both.</p>
       <p>Indicia of control include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, or common use of employees.</p>
       <p>If any employee of a covered contractor working on or in connection with a covered contract is likely to be present during the period of performance for a covered contract at a workplace controlled by a corporate affiliate of that covered contractor, that workplace is considered a covered contractor workplace.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What steps should a covered contractor take if a covered contractor employee refuses to be vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: A covered contractor should determine the appropriate means of enforcement with respect to its employee at a covered contractor workplace who refuses to be vaccinated and has not been provided, or does not have a pending request for, an accommodation. This may include the covered contractor using its usual processes for enforcement of workplace policies, such as those addressed in the contractor’s employee handbook or collective bargaining agreements.</p>
        <p>One model for enforcement among employees with respect to non-compliance with a vaccination requirement is that being followed by Federal agencies. Guidance for Federal agencies is to utilize an enforcement policy that encourages compliance, including through a limited period of counseling and education, followed by additional disciplinary measures if necessary. Removal occurs only after continued noncompliance. Guidance for Federal agencies is that employees should not be placed on administrative leave while the agency is pursuing an adverse action for refusal to be vaccinated but will be required to follow safety protocols for employees who are not fully vaccinated when reporting to agency worksites.</p>
        <p>During the time period of enforcement, the covered contractor must ensure the covered contractor employee at a covered contractor workplace is following all workplace safety protocols for individuals who are not fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p>An agency may determine that a covered contractor employee who refuses to be vaccinated in accordance with a contractual requirement pursuant to EO 14042 will be denied entry to a Federal workplace, consistent with the agency’s workplace safety protocols.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What steps should an agency take if a covered contractor does not comply with the requirements in the Task Force’s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a>?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Covered contractors are expected to comply with all requirements set forth in their contract. Where covered contractors are working in good faith and encounter challenges with compliance with COVID-19 workplace safety protocols, the agency contracting officer should work with them to address these challenges. If a covered contractor is not taking steps to comply, significant actions, such as termination of the contract, should be taken.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Does this clause apply in States or localities that seek to prohibit compliance with any of the workplace safety protocols set forth in the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a>?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. These requirements are promulgated pursuant to Federal law and supersede any contrary State or local law or ordinance. Additionally, nothing in the Task Force Guidance shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable State law or municipal ordinance establishing more protective workplace safety protocols than those established under the Task Force Guidance.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can a covered contractor comply with workplace safety requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including pursuant to any current or forthcoming Emergency Temporary Standard related to COVID-19, instead of the requirements of the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a>?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. Covered contractors must comply with the requirements set forth in the Task Force Guidance regardless of whether they are subject to other workplace safety standards.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What is the prime contractor’s responsibility for verifying that subcontractors are adhering to the mandate?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The prime contractor is responsible for ensuring that the required clause is incorporated into its first-tier subcontracts in accordance with the implementation schedule set forth in section 6 of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Order 14042</a>. When the clause is incorporated into a subcontract, a subcontractor is required to comply with the Task Force <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/Guidance for Federal Contractors_Safer Federal Workforce Task Force_20211110.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors</a> and the workplace safety protocols detailed herein. Additionally, first-tier subcontractors are expected to flow the clause down to their lower-tier subcontractors in similar fashion so that accountability for compliance is fully established throughout the Federal contract supply chain for covered subcontractor employees and workplaces at all tiers through application of the clause.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: May the prime contractor assume the subcontractor is complying with the clause?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, unless the prime contractor has credible evidence otherwise.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is COVID-19 symptom screening required before contractor employees enter a Federal facility?</strong></p>
        <p>A: If any individual, including any contractor employee, has fever or chills, or if they have other new or unexplained symptoms consistent with COVID-19 such as new or unexplained onset of cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, new or unexplained loss of taste or smell, or new or unexplained muscle aches, they should not enter a Federal workplace. If an individual suspects that they have COVID-19, such as because they have new or unexplained COVID-19 symptoms, but they do not yet have test results, they should not enter a Federal workplace and should get tested if they have not already done so. To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies would need to require that all individuals, including all contractor employees working onsite at an agency workplace, complete symptom screening before entering a Federal facility. Symptom screening can be self-conducted and does not need to be verified by agency personnel. In developing these tools, agencies may adapt the screening tool developed by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/screening/"_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>.</p>
        <p>To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies would need to allow contractor employees who tested positive for COVID-19 and had symptoms to return to working onsite at an agency workplace after 5 full days from the onset of symptoms (day 0 being the day of symptom onset, regardless of when the individual tested positive), once they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and their other symptoms are improving. Note that loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation. If at any point their COVID-19 symptoms recur or worsen, agencies must instruct the individual to again not enter a Federal facility, restarting at day 0, consistent with Executive Order 13991 and CDC recommendations on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html"_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a> and the protocols set forth by the agency.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies inquire regarding the vaccination status of contractor employees when those employees are onsite in Federal facilities?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies should pause asking onsite contractor employees to provide information about their COVID-19 vaccination status, regardless of COVID-19 Community Levels, where COVID-19 safety protocols do not vary based on vaccination status. This is true regardless of COVID-19 Community Levels.</p>
        <p>If an agency head approves an exception—following consultation with the agency COVID-19 Coordination Team, including the agency Office of General Counsel, and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force—for asking onsite contractor employees about their vaccination status because of setting-specific dependencies on vaccination information, then the agency would need to use an agency-specific form approved separately by OMB. The previously issued Government-wide <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf"_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> must not be used. If an agency head approves an exception—following consultation with the agency COVID-19 Coordination Team, including the agency Office of General Counsel, and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force—for collecting vaccination information from onsite contractor employees because of setting-specific dependencies on vaccination information, any information collection regarding the vaccination status of onsite contractor employees must be in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if applicable, would require an agency-specific System of Records Notice.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should onsite contractor employees be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test when accessing or in Federal facilities, or attending an agency-hosted meeting, event, or conference?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and CDC guidance, agencies must not put in place or implement any requirements that, solely because of their vaccination status, onsite contractor employees need to be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test when accessing or in Federal facilities, or at an agency-hosted meeting, event, or conference. This is true regardless of COVID-19 Community Levels.</p>
        <p>Following consultation with the agency COVID-19 Coordination Teams, including the agency Office of General Counsel, and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, an agency may establish COVID-19  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point-in-time screening testing</a> requirements for onsite contractor employees accessing high-risk settings within Federal facilities. Point-in-time screening testing is the testing on a situational basis of asymptomatic persons without recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for purposes of early identification, isolation, and disease prevention. For the purposes of this guidance, high-risk settings include certain Federal facilities—or certain specific settings within Federal facilities—where (1) COVID-19 transmission risk is high, and (2) the population present onsite is at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 or there is limited access to healthcare. When an agency has identified potential high-risk settings across its facilities, the agency should consult with the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force to confirm that those settings are high-risk and that conducting point-in-time screening testing in those facilities would be consistent with CDC and Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance.</p>
        <p>If an agency has established such requirements for high-risk settings, then when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Levels</a> are MEDIUM or HIGH in the county where the Federal facilities with those high-risk settings are located, agencies must require all onsite contractor employees (except those otherwise enrolled in an agency serial screening testing program, if any), regardless of their vaccination status, to be able to provide proof that they received a negative test result within 24 hours of accessing that Federal facility or high-risk setting from a viral test authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to detect current COVID-19 infection, pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance.</p>
         
        <p><strong>Q: Are contractor employees who are enrolled in a serial screening testing program for agency-designated high-risk settings limited in their ability to work onsite at the high-risk setting in between tests?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies would need to not limit the ability of contractor employees who are enrolled in an agency serial screening testing program for agency-designated high-risk settings to work onsite at the high-risk setting between screening tests, if such onsite contractor employees have met any applicable screening testing requirements, do not have fever or chills, do not have any other new or unexplained COVID-19 symptoms, and are not otherwise recommended to isolate based on agency protocols. The agency would still need to instruct such onsite contractor employees to comply with all relevant agency safety protocols.</p>
        <p>Agencies should develop procedures for addressing circumstances in which onsite contractor employees enrolled in a serial screening testing program miss their required screening test, which may include restricting the individual’s access to worksites if they have not obtained a test within a period of time specified by the agency.</p>
        <p>An onsite contractor employee’s failure to comply with screening testing requirements may result in that individual being denied entry to a Federal facility. Such circumstances do not relieve the contractor from meeting all contractual requirements.</p>
