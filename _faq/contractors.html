     <p><Strong>Update: </strong>On May 9, 2023, President Biden signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/05/09/executive-order-on-moving-beyond-covid-19-vaccination-requirements-for-federal-workers/">Executive Order</a> revoking Executive Order 14042, which had required certain parties contracting with the Federal Government to follow certain COVID-19 safety protocols. Effective May 12, 2023, all prior guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force) implementing the requirements of Executive Order 14042 has also been revoked. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the Federal Government will not take any steps to require covered contractors and subcontractors to come into compliance with previously issued Task Force guidance implementing Executive Order 14042 and will not enforce any existing contract clauses implementing Executive Order 14042. Agencies must promptly rescind any deviations, policies, or other guidance premised on Executive Order 14042, and the FAR Council has revoked its September 30, 2021 guidance regarding deviations to the FAR to implement Executive Order 14042.</p>
