<p><strong>Q: How should an agency review the local COVID-19 Community Level in order to determine appropriate COVID-19 workplace safety protocols for a Federal facility?</strong></p> 

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has set recommendations related to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/COVID-19 Community Levels_Guidance for Federal Agencies_20220817.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Levels</a>, which measure the impact of COVID-19 illness on health and healthcare systems and inform the appropriate prevention strategies to utilize at a given time.</p>
<p>CDC has provided <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">county-level data</a> showing the COVID-19 Community Level for each county in the United States, as determined by CDC. Agencies should utilize that data in determining the COVID-19 Community Level for a given facility by looking to the COVID-19 Community Level for the county in which the facility is located.</p>
<p>Agencies should review the COVID-19 Community Level for each of their facilities on a weekly basis, to determine any changes that need to be made to agency COVID-19 workplace safety protocols for the upcoming week; for example, an agency could review the COVID-19 Community Level each Friday and implement any changes to agency safety protocols due to changes in the COVID-19 Community Level starting the following Monday.</p>
