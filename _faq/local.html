<p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: How should an agency determine the level of community transmission related to a given Federal facility?</strong></p>
<p>A. In applying COVID-19 workplace safety protocols connected to levels of community transmission in a given area, agencies should reference the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker County View</a>. Agencies can use discretion in determining the counties relevant to the determination of the level of community transmission in a given area for a given Federal facility. For example, agencies may consider the county in which an agency facility is located as well as the transmission levels of surrounding local counties from which employees commute to the facility.</p>

<p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: If a locality imposes additional pandemic-related requirements more protective than those set forth in Federal guidance, do those requirements apply in Federal buildings and on Federal lands within that locality?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Where a locality imposes more protective pandemic-related safety requirements, those requirements should be followed in Federal buildings and on Federal lands within that locality.</p>
