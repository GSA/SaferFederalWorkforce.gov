        <p><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span><strong>Q: What steps should an agency take if an individual has a known exposure to someone with COVID-19?</strong></p>
        <p>A: If an asymptomatic individual has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/risks-exposure.html"_blank" rel="noopener">known exposure to someone with COVID-19</a>, CDC does not recommend quarantine at home, and so agencies must not prevent the individual from entering Federal facilities or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities due to quarantine protocols.</p>
        <p>Pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html"_blank" rel="noopener">post-exposure precautions</a>, agencies must instruct individuals who are known to have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, regardless of their vaccination status, to:</p>
        <p>1. Wear a high-quality <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"_blank" rel="noopener">mask or respirator</a> (such as an N95) while working indoors at an agency workplace or interacting indoors with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities as soon as possible after notification of exposure and continue to do so for 10 full days from the date they were last known to have been exposed; </p>
        <p>2. Take <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"_blank" rel="noopener">extra precautions</a>, such as avoiding crowding and physically distancing from others, when they know they are around people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/risks-getting-very-sick.html"_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to get very sick from COVID-19</a> while working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities, for 10 full days from the date they were last known to have been exposed; and</p>
        <p>3. Watch for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 symptoms</a> for 10 full days from the date they were last known to have been exposed. </p>
        <p>For purposes of calculating the 10 full days, day 0 is the day of their last known exposure to someone with COVID-19, and day 1 is the first full day after their last known exposure. </p>
        <p>As part of agency testing protocols, and pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance, agencies must require that such employees and contractor employees who are known to have been exposed to COVID-19 and are working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities be tested with a viral test authorized by the FDA to detect current infection at least 5 full days after their last known exposure (ideally, on or after day 6). The test can be both self-administered and self-read by the employee if the agency has the employee certify as to when they took the test and that they received a negative result. Agencies can either pay for this post-exposure diagnostic testing directly or reimburse employees for required tests.</p>
        <p>If the individual tests negative, they must continue to follow the above precautions for 10 full days from the date they were last known to have been exposed. If they test positive, or if they at any time develop COVID-19 symptoms, they must follow agency protocols on <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/quarantine-and-isolation/"_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a>. </p>
        <p>If the individual that has been known to be exposed to COVID-19 is not working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities within 10 days of the known exposure, then the agency should not require them to be tested. </p>
        <p>If the individual that has been known to be exposed to COVID-19 had tested positive for COVID-19 with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html"_blank" rel="noopener">viral test</a> within the previous 30 days and subsequently recovered and remains without COVID-19 symptoms, then they do not need to get tested after a known exposure. If the individual that had been known to be exposed to COVID-19 had tested positive for COVID-19 with a viral test within the previous 31-90 days and subsequently recovered and remains without COVID-19 symptoms, then they should be tested using a viral antigen test. (See also: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html#choosing-a-test"_blank" rel="noopener">CDC guidance on specific testing recommendations for those that have had COVID-19 within the past 90 days</a>.)</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should agencies instruct individuals with probable or confirmed COVID-19 to do?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Any individual with probable or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of their vaccination status, must not enter a Federal facility or interact with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities, consistent with CDC guidance on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html#isolation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a> and the workplace safety protocols set forth by their agency, and monitor their symptoms.</p>
        <p>This includes people who have a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive viral test</a> for COVID-19, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms, and people with symptoms of COVID-19, including people who are awaiting test results or have not been tested. People working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities who develop COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symptoms</a> must isolate even if they do not know if they have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. </p>
        <p><strong>Q: When should an agency allow an individual to return to a Federal workplace or interact with members of the public as part of their official duties after they have had COVID-19?</strong></p>
        <p>A: A tool to help determine how long you need to isolate, quarantine, or take other steps to prevent spreading COVID-19 may be found <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Individuals who had COVID-19 and had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symptoms</a> can end their isolation after 5 full days from the onset of symptoms if they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication, their other symptoms have improved, and they have met any agency testing requirements. Note that loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation​. Those individuals who end their isolation after 5 full days should continue to wear a mask around others for an additional 5 days when working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and never developed symptoms can end isolation after 5 full days after their positive COVID-19 test, assuming they have not developed symptoms and comply with any agency testing requirements. Such an individual should continue to wear a mask around others for an additional 5 days after the end of their 5-day isolation period when working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities. If they develop symptoms at any point, they should start a 5-day isolation period over, with day 0 being their first day of symptoms.</p>
        <p>As part of agency testing protocols, agencies may require that an individual take a viral antigen test prior to returning to a Federal workplace or interacting with the public as part of their official duties after isolating. Individuals should only collect a test sample if they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and their other symptoms have improved. If their test result is positive, they must continue to isolate until day 10. If their test result is negative and 5 full days have passed since they began their isolation, they can return to their workplace or begin to interact with the public as part of their official responsibilities. Such an individual must continue to wear a mask around others for 10 full days from when they began isolation. If the individual is not working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities within 10 days of when they began isolation, then the agency should not require them to be tested.</p>
        <p>As part of agency testing protocols, agencies may have employees take antigen tests twice over a three-day period with at least 24 hours and no more than 48 hours between tests, prior to returning to a Federal workplace or interacting with the public as part of their official duties after isolating. In determining whether to use a two-test approach, agencies should consider operational issues such as workforce availability, the nature of the individual’s work environment, as well as availability of funding to support diagnostic testing through the use of viral tests among isolating employees.</p>
        <p>CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting-specific guidance</a> provides additional recommendations for settings such as congregate settings and healthcare settings; where there is a conflict with more general guidance, setting-specific guidance must be followed. CDC generally recommends a 10-day isolation period for certain congregate settings (including correctional or detention facilities) that have a high risk of secondary transmission. Decisions to shorten isolation in these settings should be made in consultation with State, local, Tribal, or territorial health departments and should take into consideration the context and characteristics of the facility. The recommendations above do not apply to healthcare professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: When should an individual who was severely ill with COVID-19 or has a weakened immune system end isolation?</strong></p>
        <p>A: People who are severely ill with COVID-19 (including those who were hospitalized or required intensive care or ventilation support) and people with compromised immune systems need to isolate for at least 10 days. Individuals should consult with their healthcare provider regarding when they should end isolation.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What should agencies instruct individuals to do after ending isolation?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies must instruct individuals to continue to take precautions when working onsite at an agency workplace or interacting with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities even after ending isolation, for 10 full days after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive viral test for asymptomatic individuals including wearing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-fitting mask</a> when around others (see FAQs on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faq/mask-wearing/">mask-wearing</a>), avoiding eating and drinking around others, avoiding environments such as dining facilities and gyms where they may be unmasked around others, avoiding travel, avoiding people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease</a>, and avoiding nursing homes and other high-risk settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What if a Federal employee must undertake urgent mission-critical travel during days 6-10 after their first day of symptoms or the day of a positive viral test for an asymptomatic individual?</strong></p>
        <p>A: If an agency determines that an employee absolutely must undertake urgent mission-critical travel during days 6-10 after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive test for an asymptomatic individual, the agency should instruct the employee  to take other precautions for the entire duration of their travel, including wearing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-fitting mask</a> when around others (see FAQs on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faq/mask-wearing/">mask-wearing</a>) and, to the extent possible, avoiding eating and drinking around others, avoiding environments such as dining facilities and gyms where they may be unmasked around others, avoiding people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease</a>, and avoiding nursing homes and other high-risk settings.  </p>
