        <p><strong>Q:  Is symptom screening required before agency onsite employees, onsite contractors, and visitors come to the workplace?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  If onsite federal employees, onsite contractors or visitors do not feel well, they should not come to the workplace. Onsite federal employees and onsite contractors who need to report to the workplace must complete symptom screening before they report each day. Agencies are encouraged to use mobile or web applications, or both, to facilitate the screening process, and may adapt the tool used by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/screening/paper-version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a> (PDF, <a href="https://get2.adobe.com/reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Adobe Reader</a>). Visitors must also complete this screening.</p>
        <p>To implement symptom screening for onsite employees, onsite contractors, and visitors at entrances to GSA-controlled facilities, the FSC must vote to adopt screening criteria and procedures, and coordinate with the GSA building manager or lease administration manager, FPS, USMS, or other relevant federal security organization, as applicable.</p>

                  <li>First, the FSC must vote to adopt Enhanced Entry Screening Services (EEES).</li>
                  <li>Then the occupant agency must provide funding and develop an enforcement strategy.</li>
                  <li>Then the GSA project team will determine an appropriate acquisition strategy.</li>
                  <li>Leased facilities must coordinate with the lessor.</li>

        <p><strong>Q:  If a facility’s FSC votes to adopt symptom screening criteria and procedures at the entrances to a GSA-controlled facility, how are those services acquired, and who pays?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Once the FSC votes to adopt these “Enhanced Entry Screening Services” (EESS), the occupant agencies have provided the required funding, and an enforcement strategy is developed, the GSA project team will determine an appropriate acquisition strategy, in consultation with the FSC, using <a href="https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/app/#/gateway/professional-services/46547/enhanced-entry-screening-services-eess-for-government-facilities-procurement-resource" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSA's EESS procurement resources</a>, and acquire the services. In leased facilities, these activities must also be coordinated with the lessor. Occupant agencies are required to provide funding for these services based on their pro rata share of the facility’s rentable square footage.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:  Are GSA’s EESS procurement resources available for use in facilities managed by agencies other than GSA?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Yes, GSA’s EESS procurement resources are available for use by federal agencies managing a GSA-controlled facility under an operation and maintenance delegation issued by GSA and federal agencies managing facilities under their own independent landholding authority.</p>
