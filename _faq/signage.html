        <p>A: If appropriate signage is not already posted, GSA will post signage at building entrances and in common areas of Federally owned GSA-controlled facilities where <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Levels</a> are HIGH, indicating that masks are required. Where COVID-19 Community Levels are MEDIUM or LOW, GSA will post signage at building entrances and in common areas of Federally owned GSA-controlled facilities that mask-wearing is optional. In privately owned facilities leased by GSA, where COVID-19 Community Levels are HIGH, that signage will only be posted at building entrances and common areas if GSA leases the entire facility. In facilities where operation and maintenance has been delegated by GSA to an occupant agency, that occupant agency is responsible for obtaining and displaying the signage.</p>
