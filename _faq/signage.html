        <p><strong>Q:  What signage will be posted at GSA-controlled facilities to notify employees, contractors, and visitors of the requirement to wear masks if not fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  If appropriate signage is not already posted, GSA will post signage at building entrances and in common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities stating that for individuals who are not fully vaccinated masks are required for entry and throughout common areas and shared workspaces and anywhere else in or on the property when physical distancing cannot be maintained. In privately-owned facilities leased by GSA, signage will only be posted at building entrances and common areas if GSA leases the entire facility. In facilities where operation and maintenance has been delegated by GSA to an occupant agency, that occupant agency is responsible for obtaining and displaying the signage.</p>
