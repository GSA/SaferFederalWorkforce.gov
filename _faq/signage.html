        <p><strong>Q:  What signage will be posted at GSA-controlled facilities to notify employees, contractors, and visitors of mask-wearing requirements?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  If appropriate signage is not already posted, GSA will post signage at building entrances and in common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities regarding the facilityâ€™s mask-wearing requirements. In privately owned facilities leased by GSA, signage will only be posted at building entrances and common areas if GSA leases the entire facility. In facilities where operation and maintenance has been delegated by GSA to an occupant agency, that occupant agency is responsible for obtaining and displaying the signage.</p>
