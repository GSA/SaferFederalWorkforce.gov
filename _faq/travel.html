<p>Federal employees should adhere strictly to CDC guidance for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international</a> travel before, during, and after official travel.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on official travel for Federal employees who are fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. There are no Government-wide limits on official travel (i.e., travel conducted under an official travel authorization) for Federal employees, regardless of their vaccination status. 
  <ol>
            <li>Inform those employees that CDC recommends that individuals make sure they are up to date with COVID-19 vaccines before travel;</li>
            <li>Recommend that those employees consider being tested for current infection with a viral test as close to the time of departure as possible (no more than 3 days) before travel;</li>
            <li>Instruct those employees to adhere strictly to CDC guidance for domestic and international travel before, during, and after official travel; and</li>
            <li>Instruct those employees to check their destination’s COVID-19 situation before traveling, including given that State, Tribal, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place.</li>
   </ol>
If an employee who is not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines travels internationally either on official business (i.e., travel conducted under an official travel authorization) or for personal travel, then agencies must require such employees to follow agency quarantine  protocols and not enter a Federal facility or interact with members of the public in person as part of their official responsibilities for at least 5 full days after international travel to the United States. Employees should telework during quarantine if they are able to do so. See FAQs on Leave for more information about leave associated with quarantine following international travel. Employees should follow their agency’s travel policy. Agencies may have collective bargaining obligations regarding implementation of any changes to official travel policies that have been in place for bargaining unit employees.</p>

<p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: What should agencies do regarding official travel for individuals who develop COVID-19 symptoms or have a positive viral test 10 full days or less prior to their intended departure date?</strong></p>
<p>A: Pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance, agencies must not approve official travel (i.e., travel conducted under an official travel authorization) for individuals who have COVID-19 for 10 full days after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive viral test for asymptomatic individuals.</p>
<p>If an agency determines that an employee absolutely must undertake urgent, necessary, and mission-critical official travel during days 6-10 after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive test for an asymptomatic individual, then the agency must instruct the employee to take other precautions for the entire duration of their travel during the 10 days after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive test for an asymptomatic individual, including wearing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Feffective-masks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-fitting mask</a> when around others (see FAQs on <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/mask-wearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mask-wearing</a>) and, to the extent possible, avoiding eating and drinking around others, avoiding environments such as dining facilities and gyms where they may be unmasked around others, avoiding people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease</a>, and avoiding nursing homes and other high-risk settings.</p>
<p>The individual must also comply with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC requirement for testing prior to international travel to the United States</a>.</p>

<p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: What should agencies do if an employee has probable or confirmed COVID-19 while on official travel?</strong></p>
<p>A: If an employee has probable or confirmed COVID-19 while on official travel (i.e., travel conducted under an official travel authorization), then pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent with CDC guidance, agencies must instruct the individual to follow agency <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a> protocols and not undertake further travel, including return travel, for 10 full days after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive viral test for asymptomatic individuals. The agency is responsible for all costs associated with travel and lodging expenses, as well as the cost of any diagnostic testing, in these circumstances.</p>
<p>If an agency determines that an employee absolutely must undertake urgent, necessary, and mission-critical return travel during days 6-10 after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive test for an asymptomatic individual, then the agency must instruct the employee to take other precautions for the entire duration of their travel during the 10 days after their first day of symptoms, or after the date of a positive test for an asymptomatic individual, including wearing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Feffective-masks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-fitting mask</a> when around others (see FAQs on <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/mask-wearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mask-wearing</a>) and, to the extent possible, avoiding eating and drinking around others, avoiding environments such as dining facilities and gyms where they may be unmasked around others, avoiding people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunocompromised or at high risk for severe diseas</a>e, and avoiding nursing homes and other high-risk settings.</p>
<p>The individual must also comply with the <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/mask-wearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC requirement for testing prior to international travel to the United States</a>.</p>

<p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: What should agencies do if an employee comes into close contact with someone with COVID-19 during official travel?</strong></p>
<p>A: A: If an employee comes into close contact with someone with COVID-19 during official travel (i.e.,
travel conducted under an official travel authorization), and the employee is recommended to
quarantine for 5 days after the close contact, then pursuant to Executive Order 13991 and consistent
with CDC guidance, agencies must instruct the individual to follow agency <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarantine</a> protocols and not
undertake further travel, including return travel, for 10 full days following the close contact. The agency
must also instruct the individual to take other precautions during this period, including wearing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Feffective-masks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-
  fitting mask</a> when around others (see FAQs on <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/mask-wearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mask-wearing</a>) and, to the extent possible, avoiding
eating and drinking around others, avoiding environments such as dining facilities and gyms where they
may be unmasked around others, avoiding people who are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunocompromised or at high risk for
  severe disease</a>, and avoiding nursing homes and other high-risk settings.</p>

<p>In the rare circumstances in which the agency has an urgent, necessary, and mission-critical need for the
individual who had a close contact and is recommended to quarantine to undertake official travel,
including return travel during that time period of 6-10 days after the close contact, the agency must
require the individual to be tested 5 days after the close contact. If the test result is negative and the
  individual remains without COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symptoms</a> before traveling, the agency must instruct the individual
to wear a well-fitting mask when around others for the duration of the travel that falls within the 10 full
days after the close contact. If either the test result is positive or the individual develops COVID-19
symptoms, the agency must not approve the official travel for the individual and must instruct the
  individual to follow agency protocols on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a>. Any employees who are travelling with the individual
who has tested positive should be instructed to follow agency protocols for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarantine</a> as appropriate.</p>

<p>If an individual has had a known close contact with someone with COVID-19 during official travel, is not
recommended to quarantine due to being up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, and has not had
confirmed COVID-19 within the previous 90 days, then agencies may approve only mission-critical
official travel, including mission-critical return travel, during days 1-5 days after the close contact. The
agency may approve any official travel, including return travel, after that period, consistent with the
agency’s travel policy. In these circumstances, the agency must recommend to the individual that they
be tested for current infection with a viral test as close to the time of departure as possible (no more
than 1 day) before travel. If the test result is negative and the individual remains without COVID-19
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symptoms</a> before traveling, the agency must instruct the individual to wear a well-fitting mask when
around others for the duration of the travel that falls within the 10 full days after the close contact. If
either the test result is positive or the individual develops COVID-19 symptoms, the agency must not
approve the official travel for the individual and must instruct the individual to follow agency protocols
  on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a>. Consistent with CDC guidance and agency <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarantine</a> protocols, agencies must also require
that such individuals be tested at least 5 full days after they last had close contact with someone with
COVID-19.</p>

<p>If an individual has had a known close contact with someone with COVID-19 during official travel, is not
recommended to quarantine, and has had confirmed COVID-19 within the previous 90 days, then
agencies may approve the employee’s return travel. If the test result is negative and the individual
  remains without COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symptoms</a> before traveling, the agency must instruct the individual to wear a
well-fitting mask when around others for the duration of the travel that falls within the 10 days after the
close contact. If the individual develops COVID-19 symptoms, the agency must not approve the official
travel for the individual and must instruct the individual to follow agency protocols on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolation</a> and
testing.</p>

<p>The agency is responsible for all costs associated with travel and lodging expenses, as well as the cost of
any diagnostic testing, in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on official travel for Federal employees?</strong></p>
<p>A: For the limited number of Federal employees who are not fully vaccinated, agencies should generally observe the following guidance, unless it is contrary to a reasonable accommodation to which an employee is legally entitled. Official domestic travel should be limited to only necessary mission-critical trips.  International travel should also be avoided, if at all possible, unless it is mission critical (e.g., military deployments, COVID-19 response deployments or activities, diplomats traveling, high-level international negotiations that cannot occur remotely). Heads of agencies should issue specific guidance to account for the particulars of their agency’s mission.</p>
