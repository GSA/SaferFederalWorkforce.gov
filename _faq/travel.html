<p>Federal employees should adhere strictly to CDC guidance for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domestic</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international</a> travel before, during, and after official travel.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on official travel for federal employees who are fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. There are no government-wide limits on official travel for federal employees who are fully vaccinated. Employees should follow their agency’s travel policy. Agencies may have collective bargaining obligations regarding implementation of any changes to official travel policies that have been in place for bargaining unit employees.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on official travel for federal employees who are not fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
<p>A: For the limited number of Federal employees who are not fully vaccinated, agencies should generally observe the following guidance, unless it is contrary to a reasonable accommodation to which an employee is legally entitled. Official domestic travel should be limited to only necessary mission-critical trips.  International travel should also be avoided, if at all possible, unless it is mission critical (e.g., military deployments, COVID-19 response deployments or activities, diplomats traveling, high-level international negotiations that cannot occur remotely). Heads of agencies should issue specific guidance to account for the particulars of their agency’s mission.</p>
