        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Should agencies inquire regarding the vaccination status of Federal employees and onsite contractors</strong></p>
        <p>A. Given the different safety protocols for individuals who are fully vaccinated and those who are not fully vaccinated, agencies need to ask about the vaccination status of Federal employees and onsite contractors. Employees and onsite contractors must attest to the truthfulness of the response they provide. If an employee or onsite contractor chooses not to provide a response, they will be treated as unvaccinated for the purpose of agency safety protocols. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, and any applicable collective bargaining obligations. When an employee or contractor discloses that they are unvaccinated or declines to complete the attestation, agencies should treat that individual as not fully vaccinated for purposes of implementing safety measures, including with respect to mask wearing, physical distancing, testing, travel, and quarantine.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Should agencies inquire regarding the vaccination status of visitors to Federal buildings?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Visitors to Federal buildings should be asked to provide information about vaccination status. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Visitors who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from no later than the previous 3 days prior to entry to a Federal building.</p>
        <p>These requirements related to the provision of information about vaccination and provision of proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test do not apply to members of the public entering a Federal building or Federal land to obtain a public service or benefit. If they are not fully vaccinated, these visitors must comply with all relevant CDC guidance, including wearing a mask and physically distancing from other people.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Are agencies required to establish different safety protocols for fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated individuals?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html#vaccinated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fully vaccinated individuals</a> do not need to physically distance, undergo screening testing, or have restrictions on their official travel (although they still must comply with any local requirements and relevant CDC guidance for fully vaccinated individuals while traveling). Fully vaccinated individuals in areas of substantial or high transmission (see the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker County View</a>) need to wear a mask in public indoor settings. Fully vaccinated individuals in areas of low or moderate transmission do not need to wear a mask.</p>
        <p>Fully vaccinated individuals might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of transmission for a variety of reasons.</p>
        <p>Individuals who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status must wear masks regardless of community transmission level, physically distance, and undergo screening testing weekly or twice-weekly, and their official travel is restricted.</p>
        <p>In order to be treated as fully vaccinated pursuant to agency COVID-19 workplace safety plans and protocols, employees and onsite contractors must attest that they are fully vaccinated by signing a form provided by the agency. Visitors also will be asked to provide information about their vaccination status. Individuals who decline to provide information on their vaccination status will be treated as not fully vaccinated for purposes of agency COVID-19 workplace safety plans and protocols. Visitors who are not fully vaccinated must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test that occurred within the previous 3 days prior to entry to a Federal building.</p>
        <p>Individuals entering a Federal building or Federal land to obtain a public service or benefit do not need to provide information about their vaccination status or provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. If they are not fully vaccinated, they must comply with all relevant CDC guidance, including wearing a mask.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: What safety protocols should an agency apply to employees and onsite contractors prior to establishing a means of determining vaccination status consistent with this guidance?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies may take a reasonable period of time to establish a program for determining the vaccination status of employees and onsite contractors consistent with this guidance. Prior to an agency establishing such a program, they should continue to utilize their current means of determining the safety protocols that apply to specific employees and contractors.</p>
