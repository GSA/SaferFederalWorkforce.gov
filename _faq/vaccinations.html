        <p><strong>Q: By what date do Federal employees need to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Federal employees need to be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021.</p>
        <p>Employees will be considered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully vaccinated</a> for COVID-19 2 weeks after they have received the requisite number of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine approved or authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or that has been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. For Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca/Oxford, that is 2 weeks after an employee has received the second dose in a 2-dose series. For Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen, that is 2 weeks after an employee has received a single-dose.</p>
        <p>More information is available at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: By what date do individuals who start their government service after November 22, 2021 need to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies should require that individuals who start their government service after November 22, 2021, be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully vaccinated</a> prior to their start date, except in limited circumstances where an accommodation is legally required. Agencies should require documentation to prove vaccination prior to the enter on-duty date. However, should an agency have an urgent, mission-critical hiring need to onboard new staff prior to those new staff becoming fully vaccinated, the agency head may delay the vaccination requirement—in the case of such limited delays, agencies should require new hires to be fully vaccinated within 60 days of their start date and to follow safety protocols for not fully vaccinated individuals until they are fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p>OPM has issued <a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/guidance-applying-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-requirements-new-hires-%E2%80%93-executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further guidance</a> to agencies, including suggested language for job opportunity announcements and tentative and final offer letters.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How does the requirement for federal employees to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully vaccinated</a> apply to individuals who start their employment after the issuance of EO 14043 but prior to November 22, 2021?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies should require that individuals who start their government service prior to November 22, 2021 be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except in limited circumstances where an accommodation is legally required. Should an agency have an urgent, mission-critical hiring need to onboard new staff who cannot be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, the agency head may delay the vaccination requirement—in the case of such limited delays, agencies should require new hires to be fully vaccinated within 60 days of their start date and to follow safety protocols for not fully vaccinated individuals until they are fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p>As soon as possible, agencies should ensure that individuals who will or may start their government service prior to November 22, 2021, are aware of the requirement to be fully vaccinated by that date and how to seek an exception required by law to the vaccination requirement. OPM has issued <a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/guidance-applying-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-requirements-new-hires-%E2%80%93-executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further guidance</a> to agencies, including suggested language for job opportunity announcements and tentative and final offer letters.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: To what types of Federal employees does the vaccination requirement apply?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The vaccination requirement in Executive Order 14043 (Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees) covers employees as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 (including an employee paid from nonappropriated funds as referenced in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)). Agencies are strongly encouraged to require vaccinations for any employees or other personnel working under an agreement with an agency not covered by the Executive Order, consistent with applicable law and in consultation with the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force. Implementation of such additional requirements should generally follow the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force’s guidance for implementing the vaccination requirement in Executive Order 14043.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Does the requirement to be vaccinated apply to Federal employees who are not reporting to the worksite (e.g., are on maximum telework or working remotely)?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. To protect the health and safety of the Federal workforce and to promote the efficiency of the civil service, all Federal employees covered by Executive Order 14043 and without a legally required exception need to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully vaccinated</a> by November 22, 2021, regardless of where they are working. Employees who are on maximum telework or working remotely are not excused from this requirement, including because employees working offsite may interact with the public as part of their duties and agencies may need to recall employees who are on maximum telework or working remotely.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do agencies need to provide onsite vaccinations to their employees?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. Agencies should take steps to make their employees aware of convenient opportunities to be vaccinated. Given the <a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread availability of vaccinations</a>, it is not required that agencies provide vaccinations at their facilities or worksites, although agencies may choose to do so.</p>

            Vaccination Documentation and Information
        </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="vax-doc" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p><strong>Q: Must agencies require documentation from employees to prove vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, agencies must require documentation from employees to prove vaccination, even if an employee has previously attested to their vaccination status. Employees may provide a copy of the record of immunization from a health care provider or pharmacy, a copy of the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card, a copy of medical records documenting the vaccination, a copy of immunization records from a public health or state immunization information system, or a copy of any other official documentation containing required data points (the required data points for such other official documentation are the type of vaccine administered, date(s) of administration, and the name of the health care professional(s) or clinic site(s) administering the vaccine(s)). Employees must certify under penalty of perjury that the documentation they are submitting is true and correct.</p>
        <p>Employees may provide a digital copy of such records, including, for example, a digital photograph, scanned image, or PDF of such a record that clearly and legibly displays the information outlined above. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What steps should an agency take when an employee has lost or does not have a copy of required vaccination documentation?</strong></p>
        <p>A: If an employee states that they have lost their vaccination documentation or do not have a copy of it, the agency should direct the employee to contact the vaccination provider site where they received their vaccine. If the location where the employee received their COVID-19 vaccine is no longer operating, the employee should contact their health care provider, who, in most cases, can access a State or local health department’s immunization information system (IIS) for the employee’s record. In many States or localities, the employees may themselves be able to get their record by directly contacting the State or local health department’s IIS. Employees should contact their State or local health department if they have additional questions about vaccination cards or vaccination records.</p>
        <p>If an employee was vaccinated in another country, the agency should direct the employee to contact the vaccination provider site where they received their vaccine for information on how to obtain records. Alternatively, the employee should contact the appropriate health department in that country.</p>
        <p>If an employee who claims they are fully vaccinated is able to demonstrate to the agency a good faith effort to locate required documentation, the agency can hold any disciplinary action associated with failure to comply with the vaccination requirement in abeyance for a short period of time, pending the employee’s submission of documentation providing proof of vaccination.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can an employee provide a recent antibody test in order to prove vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. An employee must provide the required documentation for proof of vaccination. A recent antibody test cannot be used to prove vaccination status.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies request and maintain information about whether employees are up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, including collection of documentation of additional primary series doses and booster shots from employees?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Safety protocols related to quarantine are contingent in part on whether one is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to date with COVID-19 vaccines</a>, including recommended additional <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary series doses</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">booster shots</a>. To facilitate implementation of safety protocols, agencies should take steps to maintain information about whether employees are up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, including information about whether they have had recommended additional primary series doses or booster shots, including collection of documentation of proof, as part of broader agency processes and systems for maintaining information on employee vaccination status. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Agencies should consult with their legal counsel and labor relations staff to determine any collective bargaining obligations.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How should agencies maintain documentation provided by employees regarding vaccination?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies should collect certain information necessary to verify that an employee is fully vaccinated. This information should include the type of vaccine administered, the number of required primary series doses received, date of administration of each required primary series dose, and the submission of an approved form of required documentation, as set forth in this guidance. When providing this information, employees should also be required to certify under penalty of perjury that the information they are submitting is true and correct.</p>
        <p>Agencies have unique operational environments and may develop their own processes to both collect and maintain the required information, in compliance with all applicable laws and in accordance with their agency record management policies. Accordingly, agencies may develop and use new processes, systems, tools, and applications to collect and maintain the required information or choose to leverage existing processes, systems, tools, or applications previously established to collect Certification of Vaccination forms. Agency systems, processes, tools, and applications for the collection of this information should allow an employee to update their vaccination status and related information.</p>
        <p>To support implementation of safety protocols, agencies also should collect information regarding whether their employees are up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, including, for example, the type of vaccine administered, the number of additional primary series doses or booster shots received, date of administration of each additional primary series dose or booster shot, and the submission of documentation showing proof of additional primary series doses or booster shots.</p>
        <p>The collection and use of this information for many agencies is subject to the OPM/GOVT-10 Employee Medical File system of records notice (SORN) and OPM regulations (5 C.F.R. part 293, subpart E). Under those rules, each agency should have written instructions for its EMF system with appropriate safeguards. Employees should be provided with a Privacy Act statement at the point of collection of this information. Agencies that are not subject to OPM’s regulations (or who employ categories of employees not covered by OPM/GOVT-10) should give their employees an alternative <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/VaccinationPAS4.pdf"target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Act statement</a>. As a general rule, this information should not be maintained in the Official Personnel Folder.</p>
        <p>Agencies are encouraged to take steps to promote privacy and IT security, while also providing the relevant information to those who need to know in order to implement the safety protocols. Agencies should consult with their Agency Records Officer, Chief Information Officer, Senior Agency Official for Privacy, and agency’s legal counsel to determine the best means to maintain this information to meet the agency’s needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Which individuals within an agency should have access to information on employees’ vaccination status?</strong></p> 
        <p>A: The Privacy Act permits disclosure within the agency to employees “who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties.” 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1). Agencies should only disseminate information to the appropriate agency officials who have a need to know to ensure effective implementation of the safety protocols, which, in many cases, will include the supervisor level. Agencies must comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act at all times. Agencies should consult with their Senior Agency Official for Privacy on any questions related to Privacy Act requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:  Is onsite verification of vaccination status for Federal employees required as a condition of entry to GSA-controlled facilities?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  No, onsite verification of a Federal employee’s COVID-19 vaccination status is not required as a condition to enter GSA-controlled facilities. Security officers at GSA-controlled facilities will admit any Federal employee with a valid PIV card to the facility without requiring onsite proof of vaccination.</p>    
        <p>Enforcement of applicable workplace safety protocols, including any required testing for Federal employees with approved or pending exceptions, are the responsibility of occupant agencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies require documentation from onsite contractor employees to verify their attestation of vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, onsite contractor employees should attest to their vaccination status by being able to present a completed <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> while in that Federal facility.</p>
        <p>Agencies should not ask onsite contractor employees for documentation to verify their attestation. When a contractor employee declines to complete the attestation, agencies should treat that individual as not fully vaccinated for purposes of implementing its safety protocols.</p>

      </div>
        <p><strong>Q: Are there exceptions to the requirement for all employees to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Federal employees must be fully vaccinated other than in limited circumstances where the law requires an exception. In particular, an agency may be required to provide a reasonable accommodation to employees who communicate to the agency that they are not vaccinated against COVID-19 because of a disability or because of a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance. Determining whether an exception is legally required will include consideration of factors such as the basis for the claim; the nature of the employee’s job responsibilities; and the reasonably foreseeable effects on the agency’s operations, including protecting other agency employees and the public from COVID-19. Because such assessments will be fact- and context-dependent, agencies are encouraged to consult their offices of general counsel with questions related to assessing and implementing any such requested accommodations.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies establish a date by which employees should notify agencies that they are seeking a legally required exception to the requirement to not be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. In order to ensure that agencies can fully understand the effect of accommodation requests on their operations and to seek to ensure timely review of requests for an accommodation, agencies should establish a date by which employees should as a general matter notify agencies that they are seeking a legally required exception to the requirement to be fully vaccinated. Employees can submit requests for an exception after the date established by the agency.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies provide employees who are seeking a legally required exception to the vaccination requirement with a form?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. Agencies can refer to the following templates to develop a form for employees who are seeking an exception based on a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/DISABILITY REQUEST FORM - 20211004_510pm - MH508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical condition</a> (<i>template issued October 4, 2021</i>) or based on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/RELIGIOUS REQUEST FORM_FINAL REVIEW_20211003 10.29 11am.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religion</a> (<i>template updated October 29, 2021</i>). The information on the forms may be used by the agency to help determine whether the employee is entitled to an accommodation. The agency may also ask for other information as needed to determine if the individual is legally entitled to an accommodation. Agencies should consult with their senior agency official for privacy and their office of general counsel to address all legal considerations and privacy requirements in developing their forms, including but not limited to an appropriate Privacy Act Statement. Agencies should comply with any applicable recordkeeping and other requirements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: If an employee requests an accommodation, and that accommodation is denied, how long should the employee be afforded to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies should require that an employee whose request for an accommodation is denied receive their first (or, if a one-dose series, only) dose within two weeks of the final determination to deny the accommodation. If receiving a two-dose series, the employee must receive the second dose within 6 weeks of receiving the first dose.</p>
        <p>If the employee received a first dose of a two-dose series prior to seeking an accommodation, agencies should require that the employee receive their second dose within two weeks of the final determination to deny the accommodation or within a week of the earliest day by which they can receive their second dose, whichever is later.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is vaccination for COVID-19 recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant or might become pregnant in the future?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Does the CDC recommend that an employee delay vaccination due to pregnancy?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to become pregnant now, or trying to become pregnant in the future</a>. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2021/07/acog-smfm-recommend-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommend</a> that all pregnant individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, an agency may allow such an employee to delay vaccination based on the employee’s particular medical circumstances, consistent with the agency’s process for reviewing delay requests.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is an employee who has had a prior COVID-19 infection required to be fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, an employee who has had a prior COVID-19 infection is required to be fully vaccinated. The CDC recommends that vaccination of people with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be delayed until the person has recovered from the acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and has satisfied the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can an employee delay a COVID-19 vaccine because they have recently received another vaccine, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine?</strong></p>
        <p>A: COVID-19 vaccines may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines on the same day.</p>

            Enforcement of Vaccination Requirement for Employees
        </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="vax-enf" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">

        <p><strong>Q: What steps may an agency take if a Federal employee refuses to be vaccinated or provide proof of vaccination?</strong></p>

        <p>A: Employees covered by Executive Order 14043 who fail to comply with a requirement to be fully vaccinated or provide proof of vaccination and have neither received an exception or extension nor have an exception or extension request under consideration, are in violation of a lawful order. Employees who violate lawful orders are subject to discipline, up to and including termination or removal.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the Administration’s policy, agencies should initiate an enforcement process to work with employees to achieve their compliance. Accordingly, agencies should initiate the enforcement process with an appropriate period of education and counseling, including providing employees with information regarding <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html?s_cid=11565:benefits%20of%20covid%2019%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN.Grants:FY21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the benefits of vaccination</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/How-Do-I-Get-a-COVID-19-Vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways to obtain the vaccine</a>. If the employee does not demonstrate progress toward becoming fully vaccinated through completion of a required vaccination dose or provision of required documentation by the end of the counseling and education period, agencies may issue a letter of reprimand, followed by a short suspension (generally, 14 days or less). Continued noncompliance during the suspension can be followed by proposing removal. </p>
        <p>Operational needs of agencies and the circumstances affecting a particular employee may warrant departure from these guidelines if necessary, including whether to expedite or extend the enforcement process. For example, agencies may consider the length of the education and counseling period or following an initial brief suspension (14 days or less) with a longer second suspension (15 days or more), rather than moving from a first suspension to proposal of removal. That said, consistency across Government in enforcement of this Government-wide vaccine policy is desired, and the Executive Order does not permit exceptions from the vaccination requirement except as required by law.</p>
        <p>Agencies may initiate the enforcement process for employees who fail to submit documentation to show that they have completed receiving required vaccination dose(s), as long as those employees have not received an exception or extension, or the agency is not considering an exception or extension request from the employee.</p>
        <p>If an employee responds at any phase of the enforcement process by submitting proof of progress toward full vaccination (i.e., completion of a required vaccination dose), the agency should hold the discipline in abeyance to afford the employee a reasonable period of time to become fully vaccinated. </p>
        <p>In pursuing any adverse action, the agency must provide the required procedural rights to an employee and follow normal processes, including any agency policies or collective bargaining agreement requirements concerning disciplinary matters. Employees should not be placed on administrative leave while agencies are pursuing an adverse action for refusal to be vaccinated, but those employees will be required to follow safety protocols for employees who are not fully vaccinated when reporting to agency worksites.</p>
        <p>If the employee claims a legally required exception, or a medical circumstance that necessitates delay of vaccination, as the reason for not being vaccinated, an agency should follow its ordinary process to review and consider what, if any, accommodation it must offer. All agency personnel designated to receive and review requests for accommodations should know how to handle requests consistent with applicable Federal law. If the employee’s request for an exception or extension is denied, and the employee does not comply with the vaccination requirement in a timely manner, the agency may pursue disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal service.</p>

        <p>A: Yes. Agencies are strongly encouraged to incorporate vaccination requirements into contracts that are not covered by Executive Order 14042, consistent with applicable law. This might include, for example, incorporating vaccination requirements into contracts in advance of when they are otherwise required by the Executive Order or incorporating requirements into contracts that are not covered by the Executive Order, such as contracts under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. Implementation of such additional requirements should generally follow the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force’s guidance for implementing the vaccination requirement in Executive Order 14042.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies inquire regarding the vaccination status of onsite contractor employees?</strong></p>
        <p>A: When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies should ask about the vaccination status of contractor employees working onsite at that facility. Onsite contractor employees should attest to the truthfulness of the response they provide. If an onsite contractor employee chooses not to provide a response, they should be treated as not fully vaccinated for the purposes of implementing agency safety protocols. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should onsite contractor employees provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test?</strong></p>
        <p>A: When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, onsite contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status should be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days when in that facility. If a contractor employee is regularly tested pursuant to an agency testing program, then they do not need to be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days when in a Federal facility unless required to by the agency testing program.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How should an agency ask onsite contractor employees about their vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, onsite contractor employees should be provided with the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> when they enter that facility.</p>
        <p>Unless an agency has an existing system of records notice that permits it to collect and maintain this information on its onsite contractor employees, agencies should direct onsite contractor employees to complete the Certification of Vaccination form and keep it with them during their time on Federal premises—they may be asked to show the form when in the Federal facility and to a Federal employee who oversees their work.</p>
        <p>When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, onsite contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated (or who decline to disclose vaccination status) should be able to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test result from within the previous 3 days when in that facility. If a contractor employee is enrolled in an agency screening testing program, then they do not need to be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days when in a Federal facility unless required to by the agency screening testing program.</p>
        <p>Agencies may email the Certification of Vaccination form to contractor employees in advance of their time on-site or utilize a tool or application to share the form with contractor employees and enable them to easily complete it, but the agency should not maintain Certification of Vaccination forms from contractor employees unless an agency has a system of records notice that covers its collection of this information from onsite contractor employees. Any such collection, storage, or maintenance of the attestation disclosure forms may implicate the Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:  When will updated entry protocols related to vaccination status for visitors seeking to access GSA-controlled facilities take effect?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  GSA Facility Managers and Lease Administration Managers will convene Facility Security Committees (FSCs), or equivalent security committees, as applicable, to discuss COVID-19 entry protocols for visitors to GSA-controlled facilities.</p>
        <p>These protocols will go into effect on a facility-by-facility basis after the following conditions have been met:
        <ul>
            <li>FSCs must provide the agency with protection responsibility for the facility, typically either the Department of Homeland Security - Federal Protective Service (DHS-FPS) or the Department of Justice - U.S. Marshals Service (DOJ-USMS), with a list of public services and benefits provided by all occupant agencies in the facility.</li>
            <li>GSA must post signage at facility entrances indicating that visitors seeking to access the facility for reasons other than to obtain a public service or benefit must present a completed Certification of Vaccination Form to the security officers as a condition of entry, and that visitors seeking to access the facility to obtain a public service or benefit must declare such to the security officers. The signage will also indicate that all visitors are required to follow required safety protocols while accessing the facility, such as mask wearing and physical distancing.</li>
        </ul>    
        </p>
        <p>The list of public services and benefits provided by all occupant agencies in the facility will be included in the post orders for the security officers, and security officers will admit visitors who indicate they are entering the facility to obtain a public service or benefit without a completed Certification of Vaccination Form, if the identified public service or benefit is on the list provided by the FSC. If there is a dispute over a particular public service or benefit, the visitor will need to contact the agency providing the public service or benefit for assistance. If occupant agency contact information signage is not currently posted at a GSA-controlled facility, GSA will post that signage at the same time that the visitor access signage is posted.</p>
        <p>In GSA-controlled facilities with no onsite protection provided by either DHS-FPS or DOJ-USMS, occupant agencies are responsible for enforcement of visitor access protocols.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: If an agency has a system of records notice that covers its collection of information on vaccination status from onsite contractor employees, can the agency collect that information?</strong></p> 
        <p>A: Yes, if an agency has a system of records notice that covers its collection of the requisite information—as reflected in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a>—from onsite contractor employees consistent with the Privacy Act, it may do so. The agency should ensure such a collection is also consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act.  The agency should provide a means for individuals to update their vaccination status over time.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should agencies discuss vaccination plans with their employee unions?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes. Because agencies need to act quickly due to the COVID-19 emergency and to protect the health and safety of federal employees, contractor employees, and visitors, agencies should engage with employee unions at their earliest opportunity regarding the requirement for agency employees to be vaccinated. The Government-wide policy covers specific implementation steps that agencies need to take, as well as a deadline for implementation. Additional guidance on the policy will be forthcoming that will address further implementation issues. Accordingly, bargaining over this Government-wide policy will be limited to impact and implementation issues not otherwise addressed in the guidance. Moreover, agencies must implement Government-wide policy by the deadline, so any bargaining that has not been completed by the time implementation must begin will have to be finished post-implementation.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Who is considered fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: People are considered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully vaccinated</a> for COVID-19 ≥2 weeks after they have received the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or ≥2 weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen). There is currently no post-vaccination time limit on fully vaccinated status.</p>
        <p>This guidance applies to COVID-19 vaccines currently either approved or authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson [J&J]/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines). This guidance can also be applied to COVID-19 vaccines that have been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (e.g., AstraZeneca/Oxford). More information is available at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can an employee who participates in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine be considered fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Clinical trial participants within or outside the United States who are documented to have received the recommended primary series doses of a WHO-EUL COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., not placebo) that is not FDA-approved or FDA-authorized, or a vaccine that is not listed for emergency use by WHO but for which a U.S. data and safety monitoring board or equivalent has independently confirmed efficacy, can be considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they have completed the vaccine series. More information is available <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#vaccinated-part-clinical-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

        <p><strong> Q: Can an employee who has received a heterologous primary vaccine series be considered fully vaccinated?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks after receipt of the last dose if they have received any combination of two doses of an FDA approved or authorized or WHO emergency use listed COVID-19 two-dose series. For these purposes, the second dose in a two dose heterologous series must have been received no earlier than 17 days (21 days with a 4-day grace period) after the first dose.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span>Q: If a Federal employee seeks to enter a facility under the control of another agency, should they complete a Certification of Vaccination form (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB) at that facility?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, Federal employees generally are treated as visitors during their visit to a facility under the control of another agency, meaning when the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> in the county where the agency facility is located is MEDIUM or HIGH, they should complete a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB) and, if they are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide their vaccination information, they should be able to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within the past 3 days. As with other visitors, the employee should keep the documentation with them during their time onsite at the other agency.</p>
