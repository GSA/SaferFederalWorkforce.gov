        <p><strong><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span>Q: Should agencies inquire regarding the vaccination status of visitors to Federal buildings?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, when the COVID-19 Community Level is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies would need to ask visitors to that facility to provide information about vaccination status for purposes of applying agency safety protocols. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. </p>
        <p>When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies also would need to require that visitors who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days prior to entry to that facility.</p>
        <p>To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies would need to ensure individuals entering a Federal building or Federal land to obtain a public service or benefit do not need to attest to their vaccination status or show documentation of a negative COVID-19 test result, regardless of the COVID-19 Community Level in the county where the Federal facility they are visiting is located. However, these visitors would need to follow required safety protocols while accessing the facility.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span>Q: How should an agency ask visitors about their vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, when the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies would need to provide visitors with the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB) when they enter that facility. Agencies should direct visitors to complete the Certification of Vaccination form (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB) and keep it with them during their time on Federal premises—visitors may be asked to show the form upon entry to the Federal facility. If they are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide information about their vaccination status, the agency would need to require that the visitor be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test result from within the previous 3 days.</p>
        <p>Agencies may email the Certification of Vaccination form (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB) to visitors in advance of arrival or utilize a tool or application to share the form with visitors and enable visitors to easily complete it, but the agency should not maintain Certification of Vaccination forms from visitors.</p>
        <p>To be consistent with Task Force guidance, agencies would need to ensure that individuals entering a Federal building or Federal land to obtain a public service or benefit do not need to attest to their vaccination status or show documentation of a negative COVID-19 test result, regardless of the COVID-19 19 Community Level in the county where the Federal facility they are visiting is located. However, these visitors would need to follow required safety protocols while accessing the facility.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span>Q: Should agencies require documentation from visitors to verify their attestation of vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, when the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies would need to ask visitors to that facility (except those visitors seeking a public benefit or service, who do not need to attest to or otherwise document vaccination status) to attest to their vaccination status using the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> (or an agency-specific certification form approved by OMB), but agencies should not ask those visitors for documentation to verify their attestation.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should visitors to Federal facilities provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, when the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, agencies would need to require that visitors who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days when in that facility. At GSA-controlled facilities, it is the responsibility of the occupant agency associated with the visitor to ensure that individuals accessing the facility have the appropriate documentation given their COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>
        <p>To be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance, agencies would need to ensure that individuals entering a Federal building or Federal land to obtain a public service or benefit do not need to show documentation of a negative COVID-19 test result, regardless of the COVID-19 Community Level in the county where the Federal facility they are visiting is located. However, these visitors would need to follow required safety protocols while accessing the facility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: When the COVID-19 Community Level in a county where a Federal facility is located is MEDIUM or HIGH, what type of negative COVID-19 test result should a visitor or onsite contractor employee who is not fully vaccinated be able to show documentation of when in that facility?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Agencies may determine what types of tests a visitor or onsite contractor employee who is not fully vaccinated must be able to show documentation of when in a Federal facility that is in a county where the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH, provided that the tests are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to detect current infection and produce a dated result. At GSA-controlled facilities, it is the responsibility of the occupant agency associated with the visitor or onsite contractor employee to ensure that individuals accessing the facility have the appropriate documentation given their COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Q: Should visitors seeking to access GSA-controlled facilities be required to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 as a condition of entry?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  No, visitors seeking to access GSA-controlled facilities should not be required to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 as a condition of entry. Visitors should follow required workplace safety protocols consistent with their vaccination status while accessing the facility. </p>
        <p>When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> in the county where a Federal facility is located is MEDIUM or HIGH, visitors should present a completed <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certification of Vaccination form</a> to the security officer as a condition of entry to that facility. Security officers will admit visitors to GSA-controlled facilities after being presented with the Certification of Vaccination form. Security officers will not collect a visitor’s Certification of Vaccination form. Occupant agencies are responsible for providing the Certification of Vaccination form to their visitors, determining the vaccination status of the visitor, and ensuring the visitor has the appropriate documentation given their COVID-19 vaccination status.</p> 
        <p>Visitors wishing to enter a Federal facility to obtain a public service or benefit should not be required to present a completed Certification of Vaccination form to the security officer as a condition of entry, although they should follow required safety protocols consistent with their vaccination status while accessing the facility.</p>
        <p>Delivery drivers, couriers, U.S. Postal Service employees, Federal Express employees, United Parcel Service employees, and other “transient visitors”, meaning visitors accessing a Federal facility for less than approximately 15 minutes who interact with very few people, should not be required to present a completed Certification of Vaccination form to the security officer as a condition of entry, even when the local COVID-19 Community Level in the county where the Federal facility is located is MEDIUM or HIGH. They should be required to follow required safety protocols consistent with their vaccination status while accessing the facility.</p>
        <p>Additionally, emergency personnel responding to an emergency in a Federal facility, as determined by GSA, a facility’s security officers, or individual occupant agencies within a facility, should not be required to present a completed Certification of Vaccination form to the security officer as a condition of entry, even when the local COVID-19 Community Level in the county where the Federal facility is located is MEDIUM or HIGH. They should be required to follow required safety protocols consistent with their vaccination status while accessing the facility.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on the size of agency-hosted in-person meetings, events, or conferences?</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. Should an agency intend to host a meeting, conference, or event that will be attended in-person by more than 50 participants at a facility in a county where the COVID-19 Community Level is HIGH, the agency would need to first seek the approval of its agency head or official to which this responsibility has been delegated, in consultation with the agency’s COVID-19 Coordination Team, to be consistent with Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance.</p>
        
        <p><span class="usa-tag">Updated</span><strong>Q: Should in-person attendees at meetings, conferences, and events hosted by an agency be asked to provide information about vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: To implement workplace safety protocols and be consistent with Task Force guidance, for meetings, conferences, and events hosted by an agency at a facility in a county where the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH, the hosting agency would need to ask in-person attendees to provide information about their vaccination status. In requesting this information, agencies must comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>
        <p>For these meetings, conferences, and events, agencies would need to require that in-person attendees who are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide information about their vaccination status also provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test completed within the previous 3 days.</p> 
        <p>All in-person attendees at any meetings, conferences, or events hosted by Federal agencies must comply with relevant safety protocols.</p>
