        <p><strong>Q:  What alternative procedures should agencies put in place for visitors unable to access workspaces due to the masking, screening, or other requirements in the “Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask-Wearing” executive order?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Agencies must develop and implement alternative procedures that allow for persons denied access to a federal facility or otherwise unable to access an agency’s workspace to continue to obtain any federal government benefits or services to which the individual is entitled, such as monetary benefit payments or required adjudicative appointments or hearings.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Should visitors to Federal facilities provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test?</strong></p>
        <p>A: When the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH in a county where a Federal facility is located, visitors who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide information about their vaccination status should be able to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the previous 3 days when in that facility. At GSA-controlled facilities, it is the responsibility of the occupant agency associated with the visitor to ensure that individuals accessing the facility have the appropriate documentation given their COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>
        <p>Members of the public entering a Federal facility to obtain a public service or benefit do not need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. If they are not fully vaccinated, visitors should comply with all relevant CDC guidance and follow established safety protocols for that facility, consistent with their vaccination status.</p>

        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Are there restrictions on the size of agency-hosted in-person meetings, events, or conferences?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  No. Should an agency intend to host a meeting, conference, or event that will be attended in-person by more than 50 participants at a facility in a county where the COVID-19 Community Level is HIGH, the agency should first seek the approval of its agency head or official to which this responsibility has been delegated, in consultation with the agency’s COVID-19 Coordination Team.</p>
        
        <p><span class="usa-tag">New</span><strong>Q: Should in-person attendees at meetings, conferences, and events hosted by an agency be asked to provide information about vaccination status?</strong></p>
        <p>A: For meetings, conferences, and events hosted by an agency at a facility in a county where the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Community Level</a> is MEDIUM or HIGH, all in-person attendees should be asked to provide information about their vaccination status. In requesting this information, agencies should comply with any applicable Federal laws, including requirements under the Privacy Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>
        <p>For these meetings, conferences, and events, in-person attendees who are not fully vaccinated or decline to provide information about their vaccination status should provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test completed within the previous 3 days and comply with relevant safety protocols, consistent with their vaccination status.</p>
