By January 26, 2021, each agency should establish a COVID-19 Coordination Team. This team should — at minimum — include a representative from: each component agency (if applicable); HR; occupational safety and health; executive leadership; counsel’s office; and a public health expert. If such an expert does not exist at the agency, a delegate will be designated by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force. The team is responsible for conducting assessments in order to establish, implement, and monitor compliance with: (a) safety protocols for physical space and masking; and (b) determinations of on-site and telework/remote working. The group should meet regularly to review compliance with agency COVID-19 workplace safety plans and protocols, consider potential revisions to agency COVID-19 workplace safety plans and protocols, and any other operational needs. For CFO Act agencies, this team should review draft COVID-19 workplace safety plans and protocols for the agency, make any necessary changes, and submit plans to the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force for review and comment. Where appropriate, the agency’s COVID-19 Coordination Team may consult with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). For privately owned and Federally leased space, the team should coordinate with GSA and building security and safety committees.
