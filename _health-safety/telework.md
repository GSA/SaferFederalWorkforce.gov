Employees currently working remotely on a frequent or regular basis (e.g., if on an expanded remote work schedule, such as “maximum telework”) will be given advance notice and guidance before returning to the physical workplace. The agency’s human resources (HR) team will evaluate activities, on an ongoing basis, that may require on-site work.

As a general principle, every effort will be made to maximize the use of remote work during widespread community transmission. Unless it is physically impossible or poses a threat to critical national security interests, generally speaking, occupancy in Federal workplaces should be no more than 25% of normal capacity during periods of significant or high community transmission, as discussed further in the occupancy section below. Levels of community transmission can be established by consulting CDC’s [COVID Data Tracker County View](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view).
