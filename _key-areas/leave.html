            <li>Agencies should grant a minimum of 4 hour of leave, per vaccine dose, with a minimum leave of 8 hours for two doses.</li>
            <li>Agencies should take into account extraneous curcumstances such as additional travel time.</li>

        <p><strong>Q:  Would it be appropriate for an agency to grant administrative leave to cover the period of time it takes an employee to receive a COVD-19 vaccination shot?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Yes. An agency head (or authorized designee) has discretionary authority to grant administrative leave in appropriate circumstances. To facilitate expeditious vaccination of the Federal workforce, agencies should offer leave-eligible employees a minimum of four hours of administrative leave per dose to use as neededâ€”for a minimum total of eight hours of leave for employees receiving two doses. (If an employee needs to spend less time getting the vaccine, only the needed amount of administrative leave should be granted.) Agencies should also recognize that some employees may face extenuating circumstances warranting additional administrative leave as appropriate (e.g., they may need to travel long distances to get the vaccine). Teleworking employees should normally obtain advance approval from their supervisor before being permitted to use administrative leave for COVID-19 vaccination purposes. Employees may not be credited with administrative leave or overtime work for time spent getting a vaccination outside their tour of duty.</p>

                        <li>Employees may be required to quarantine after official or personal travel.</li>

        <p><strong>Q:  Will personnel need to take personal leave / sick leave days for quarantining as a result of travel?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  Employees should be aware that official or personal travel may result in a mandatory quarantine before they are allowed to return to the workplace.</p>
        <p>If quarantine is required because of official travel or workplace exposure, agencies should provide weather and safety leave, or other administrative leave.</p>
        <p>If quarantine is required because of personal travel, and the employee is otherwise expected to be present onsite, the employee may take personal leave while quarantining. If an employee refuses to quarantine or refuses to take personal leave while under mandatory quarantine <strong><em>after personal travel</em></strong>, an agency may elect to bar the employee from the workplace for the safety of others. If the agency bars the employee from the workplace, the employee must be placed on administrative leave until the agency determines what status the employee should be placed in while on quarantine.  Agencies, however, should avoid placing an employee on extended administrative leave in this situation and should act quickly to determine the appropriate status for the employee.</p>

            Quarantine - Positive diagnosis
        </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">

        <p><strong>Q: Will personnel need to take sick leave while quarantining after testing positive for COVID-19?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Yes, if an employee is subject to isolation due to being infected with COVID-19 and is unable to telework, the employee may request sick leave, as weather and safety leave would be unavailable. Employees may also request accrued annual leave and other forms of paid or unpaid leave in this situation as appropriate.  See CPM 2020-02, February 7, 2020.</p>

            Leave - Weather and safety

    </h2>
    <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">

        <p><strong>Q: At this stage of the COVID-19 national emergency, how should agencies be administering weather and safety leave?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The guidance OPM has provided on the use of weather and safety leave in connection with the COVID-19 is still applicable. In addition to identifying certain specific covered circumstances, OPM communicated the general principle that, subject to statutory and regulatory limitations, agencies should use available flexibilities to provide weather and safety leave in circumstances where allowing an employee to travel to or perform work at the normal worksite would pose significant safety risks for the employee, other employees, or the general public. (See March 19, 2020, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/covid-19/fact-sheet-additional-guidance-in-connection-with-the-covid-19-emergency/" target="_blank">OPM Fact Sheet</a>.)  OPM has advised that weather and safety leave should not be used when an employee was capable of teleworking (5 CFR 630.1605) or when the employee is sick with COVID-19 or otherwise in circumstances under which sick leave was appropriate.</p>
