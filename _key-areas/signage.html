                  <li>GSA will post signs about mask wearing requirements in entries and common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities.</li>

        <p><strong>Q:  What signage will be posted at GSA-controlled facilities to notify employees, contractors, and visitors of the requirement to wear masks?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  If appropriate signage is not already posted, GSA will post signage at building entrances and in common areas of federally owned GSA-controlled facilities stating that masks are required for entry and throughout common areas and shared workspaces and anywhere else in or on the property when physical distancing cannot be maintained. In privately-owned facilities leased by GSA, signage will only be posted at building entrances and common areas if GSA leases the entire facility. In facilities where operation and maintenance has been delegated by GSA to an occupant agency, that occupant agency is responsible for obtaining and displaying the signage.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:  Our agency would like to post signage in our agency’s space. Where can we find signage for this purpose?</strong></p>
        <p>A:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) website makes signage available for free download. You can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/print-resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access the site here</a> . Your GSA building manager or lease administration manager will also make the signage that is used in the public areas of the building available for use by the occupant agencies.</p>
