On September 9, President Biden signed Executive Order 14042, [Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/), which directs executive departments and agencies to ensure that contracts and contract-like instruments covered by the order include a clause requiring the contractor—and their subcontractors at any tier—to, for the duration of the contract, comply with all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by the Task Force. These workplace safety protocols will apply to all covered contractor employees, including employees in covered contractor workplaces who are not working on a Federal Government contract or contract-like instrument. This action is a key step in implementing part of the President’s [Path Out of the Pandemic: COVID-19 Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/).
