<ul>
<li>NOTE: To ensure compliance with an applicable preliminary nationwide injunction, which may be supplemented, modified, or vacated, depending on the course of ongoing litigation, the Federal Government will take no action to implement or enforce the COVID-19 vaccination requirement pursuant to Executive Order 14043 on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees. Safer Federal Workforce Task Force guidance on other Federal agency safety protocols remains in effect.

<ul>
<li>NOTE (October 19, 2022): Consistent with the <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/">October 14, 2022 notification</a> from the Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (&ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;), OMB has issued <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/OMB%20Guidance%20for%20Agencies_EO%2014042_20221019.pdf">guidance</a> to agencies concerning the implementation of Executive Order 14042, <em>Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors</em> (Sept. 9, 2021). Despite the lifting of the nationwide bar to enforcement on October 18, 2022, at this time agencies should not: (1) take any steps to require covered contractors and subcontractors to come into compliance with previously issued Task Force guidance; or (2) enforce any contract clauses implementing Executive Order 14042. To allow time to develop advice and processes for meeting agencies&rsquo; obligations under Executive Order 14042 and applicable court orders, agencies should follow the instructions provided in the OMB guidance <a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/OMB%20Guidance%20for%20Agencies_EO%2014042_20221019.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>NOTE (October 14, 2022): The Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) and the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (&ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;) previously provided guidance explaining that, to ensure compliance with an applicable preliminary nationwide injunction, the Federal Government will take no action to enforce any contract clause implementing requirements of Executive Order 14042 absent further written notice from the contracting agency. In anticipation of a potential narrowing of the existing nationwide injunction due to developments in ongoing litigation, OMB and the Task Force are clarifying that they anticipate that three guidance documents will be issued following any narrowing of the nationwide injunction. <u>First</u>, after any narrowing of the nationwide injunction, OMB will issue a notice to Federal agencies regarding, among other things, compliance with applicable injunctions and whether contract clauses implementing Executive Order 14042 should be included in new solicitations and contracts. <u>Second</u>, after the anticipated narrowing of the nationwide injunction, the Task Force will issue updated written guidance regarding COVID-19 safety protocols for covered contractor and subcontractor workplace locations, which will include a timeline for implementation. This updated guidance will be issued following development and review by the Task Force, subject to the OMB Director&rsquo;s approval and determination published in the Federal Register that the updated guidance promotes economy and efficiency in Federal contracting, in accordance with Executive Order 14042. <u>Third</u>, after this updated Task Force guidance is issued and if the OMB Director makes the requisite determinations, OMB will provide guidance to agencies regarding timeline and considerations for the contracting agency&rsquo;s written notice to contractors regarding enforcement of any contract clauses implementing requirements of Executive Order 14042, excepting any contracts or contractors covered by applicable injunctions. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors">For Federal Contractors</a> for additional information.&nbsp;</li>
